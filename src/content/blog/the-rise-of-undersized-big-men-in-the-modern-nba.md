# The Rise of Undersized Big Men in the Modern NBA

The NBA has always evolved, but few shifts have been as dramatic as the transformation of the center position. Gone are the days of the towering, rim-protecting behemoths who lived in the paint. Enter the undersized big men—players like Nikola Jokic, Draymond Green, and Al Horford—who blend size with skill, vision, and basketball IQ to dominate in ways traditional bigs never could.

## Why Undersized Bigs Are Thriving

Modern basketball emphasizes versatility. Teams prioritize spacing the floor, quick transitions, and defensive switching. At 6'10" or shorter for their positions, these players aren't just holding down the fort; they're orchestrating offenses and disrupting defenses on the perimeter.

Take Jokic, the Denver Nuggets' MVP maestro. Standing at 6'11", he averages triple-doubles with pinpoint passing that rivals point guards. His ability to read defenses and make the right play has led the Nuggets to a championship, proving that height isn't everything when you have genius-level feel for the game.

Draymond Green, at 6'6", exemplifies defensive versatility. He's the anchor of the Warriors' dynasty, guarding 1 through 5 while facilitating from the high post. His antics aside, Green's impact on winning is undeniable—teams with players like him boast higher efficiency ratings.

## Impact on Team Strategy

Coaches are adapting. The pick-and-roll has evolved into a multi-option weapon, with undersized bigs popping for threes or rolling to the rim. Defensively, they allow for small-ball lineups that wear down opponents with speed.

Data backs this up: According to NBA Advanced Stats, teams employing undersized bigs in starting lineups saw a 15% increase in pace-adjusted offensive ratings last season. It's a trend that's here to stay, forcing traditional centers to adapt or fade away.

## The Future of the Position

Looking ahead, expect more hybrid forwards to fill center roles. Prospects like Evan Mobley (6'11") and Jaren Jackson Jr. (6'10") are already blending shot-blocking with perimeter skills. As the game globalizes, international talents with finesse over power will continue to shine.
