# Topic 5: The Rise of Versatile Big Men in NBA Lineups

In the ever-evolving landscape of the NBA, the role of the big man has undergone a dramatic transformation. Gone are the days of the pure post scorer or rim protector who rarely ventured beyond the paint. Today, stars like Nikola Jokić, Joel Embiid, and even emerging talents like Evan Mobley are redefining what it means to be a center or power forward.

## The Shift Towards Versatility

CourtVision Daily has tracked this trend through advanced metrics. In the 2023-24 season, big men who can handle the ball and shoot from distance contributed to a 15% increase in team offensive ratings when sharing the floor with multiple ball-handlers. Jokić, for instance, led the league in potential assists from the center position, showcasing his uncanny vision that rivals point guards.

### Key Stats Highlighting the Change
- **Three-Point Attempts**: Bigs attempted 3s at a rate 40% higher than five years ago.
- **Assist Numbers**: Top versatile bigs averaged 5+ assists per game, up from under 3.
- **Usage Rate**: These players command usage rates similar to stars like Luka Dončić.

## Case Study: Jokić's Masterclass

Denver's Jokić isn't just a scorer; he's a conductor. His ability to read defenses and make precise passes out of double-teams has made the Nuggets' offense nearly unstoppable. Analytics show his gravity pulls defenders away, creating open looks for teammates.

Embiid, on the other hand, combines brute force with finesse. His post-ups transition seamlessly into kick-outs, exploiting mismatches.

## Implications for Teams

Front offices are now prioritizing bigs with high basketball IQ over raw athleticism. This shift favors teams that build around skill rather than size alone. As we head into the 2024-25 season, expect more hybrid bigs to dominate.

What do you think? Will this trend continue, or will we see a return to traditional roles? Drop your thoughts in the comments.
